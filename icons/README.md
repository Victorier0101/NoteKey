# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Solution

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons. Here's how to create them:

### Option 1: Use Online Tools
Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/ and upload your logo to generate all sizes.

### Option 2: Create Simple Placeholder Icons
You can create simple colored squares with text "NK" (for NoteKey) using any image editor.

Recommended colors:
- Background: #2196F3 (blue)
- Text: White
- Design: Simple, clean, and recognizable

### Option 3: Download Free Icons
You can use free icons from:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://icons8.com/
- https://www.iconfinder.com/

Make sure to follow the licensing requirements for any icons you use.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Icons are not yet added to this directory.**

The extension will not load properly without these icon files. Please add them before loading the extension in Chrome.
